# Quadcopter_Control
PD Control of Quadcopter and use of State Machine in Matlab. Project at Carnegie Mellon University.

## Objectives
1. Develop a quadcopter model and implement PD feedback controller.
2. Develop a state machine to enable the robot to takeoff, hover, track a trajectory, and land. Trajectories can be either a quadratic formulation of continuous waypoints or a single desired waypoint like an impulse.
